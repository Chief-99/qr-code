### Built with

### What I learned

I learnt how to position things a bit better and also just how to solve problems in general using the internet a bit. I also learnt that I am more capable than I think and I shouldn't underestimate myself, which is pretty cool.

### Continued development

I think the main thing I want to improve on is being more concise with my code because I could have completed this with a few less lines of code.
